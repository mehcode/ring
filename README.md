*ring*
======

*ring* is focused on the implementation, testing, and optimization of a core
set of cryptographic operations exposed via an easy-to-use (and hard-to-misuse)
API. *ring* exposes a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) API and is written in
a hybrid of Rust, C, and assembly language.

Particular attention is being paid to making it easy to build and integrate
*ring* into applications and higher-level frameworks, and to ensuring that
*ring* works optimally on small devices, and eventually microcontrollers, to
support Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

*ring* is focused on general-purpose cryptography. WebPKI X.509 certificate
validation is done in the [webpki](https://github.com/briansmith/webpki)
project, which is built on top of *ring*. Also, multiple groups are working on
implementations of cryptographic protocols like TLS, SSH, and DNSSEC on top of
*ring*.

*ring* is the successor of an earlier project called GFp. GFp implemented some
elliptic curve cryptography over prime finite fields, also known as prime
Galois fields and often denoted GF(p). When we implemented RSA, the name GFp
did not make as much sense, since modular arithmetic over RSA public moduli is
not GF(p) arithmetic but rather finite commutative *ring* arithmetic. Also note
that *ring* started as a subset of BoringSSL, and “*ring*” is a substring of
“Bo*ring*SSL”.

Most of the C and assembly language code in *ring* comes from BoringSSL, and
BoringSSL is derived from OpenSSL. *ring* merges changes from BoringSSL
regularly. Also, several changes that were developed for *ring* have already
been merged into BoringSSL.




Documentation
-------------

See the documentation at
https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/.

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions on how to build it. These
instructions are especially important on Windows when not building from
crates.io, as there are build prerequisites that need to be installed.



Benchmarks
----------

*ring*'s benchmarks are in the
[crypto-bench](https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench) project. Because
there is lots of platform-specific code in *ring*, and because *ring* chooses
dynamically at runtime which optimized implementation of each crypto primitive
to use, it is very difficult to publish a useful single set of benchmarks;
instead, you are highly encouraged to run the benchmarks yourselves on your
target hardware.




Contributing
------------

The *ring* project happily accepts pull requests without you needing to sign
any formal license agreement. The portions of pull requests that modify
existing files must be licensed under the same terms as the files being
modified. New files in pull requests, including in particular all Rust code,
must be licensed under the ISC-style license. Please state that you agree to
license your contributions in the commit messages of commits in pull requests,
e.g. by putting this at the bottom of your commit message:

```

I agree to license my contributions to each file under the terms given
at the top of each file I changed.
```

The most important contributions are *uses* of *ring*. That is, we're very
interested in seeing useful things built on top of *ring*, like implementations
of TLS, SSH, the Noise Protocol, etc.

Of course, contributions to *ring*'s code base are highly appreciated too. If
you want to work directly on *ring* and you don't have an idea for something to
contribute already, see these curated lists of open issues:

* [good-first-bug](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/labels/good-first-bug):
  Bugs that we think newcomers might find best to start with. Note that what
  makes a bug a good fit depends a lot on the developer's background and not
  just the hardness of the work.
* [oxidation](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/projects/1): Replacing
  C code with Rust code.
* [rsa](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/labels/rsa): The primary *ring*
  developer is less interested in RSA than ECC and other things, and it would
  be great to have somebody jump in and "own" the RSA work. *ring* has
  inherited the fastest open source RSA implementation (as far as we know)
  from BoringSSL/OpenSSL, and we've already done a lot of cleanup. But, there's
  a lot more work to do.

In addition, we're always interested in these kinds of contributions:

* Expanded benchmarks in the
  [crypto-bench](https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench) project.
* Additional testing code and additional test vectors.
* Static analysis and fuzzing in the continuous integration.
* Support for more platforms in the continuous integration (e.g. Android, iOS,
  ARM microcontrollers).
* Documentation improvements.
* More code simplification, especially eliminating dead code.
* Improving the code size, execution speed, and/or memory footprint.
* Fixing any bugs you may have found.
* Better IDE support for Windows (e.g. running the tests within the IDE) and
  macOS (e.g. Xcode project files).

Before submitting pull requests, make sure that the tests succeed both when
running `cargo test` and `cargo test --features=rsa_signing`. See
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for more info about the features flags that are
useful for people hacking on *ring*.



Online Automated Testing
------------------------

Travis CI is used for Android, Linux, and macOS. Appveyor is used for Windows.
The tests are run in debug and release configurations, for the current release
of each Rust channel (Stable, Beta, Nightly), for each configuration listed in
the table below. The C compilers listed are used for compiling the C portions.
